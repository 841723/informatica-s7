<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"></p><div><div><strong>Time and Date</strong></div><div>The test will take place on 18 November 2024 from 12.45 PM in our standard room (O15-3.47). Note that this is during the regular times of the Data Visualization course, which means that Dataviz will start later. The duration of the test will be 1 hour.</div><br><div><strong>Allowed resources</strong></div><div>It is an open book test, but usage of internet and AI-based code generation tools are forbidden. This means:</div><br><div><ul><li>You are allowed use any cheat sheet, Python built-in help, scripts and Notebooks from our classes, or other resources that you have either stored on your laptop or printed out</li><li>You are not allowed to use the internet and/or code generation tools such as Chat GPT and Github Copilot. When the exercises and data is distributed, I will ask you to turn off WiFi for the duration of the test. Violation of this rule will result in a score of 0 points and it will be reported to the examination office.</li></ul></div><br><div><strong>Topics</strong></div><div><ul><li>You will get data files and a Jupyter Notebook with questions that you need to work through.</li><li>Questions will require in particular your expertise in data reading, data cleaning, data analysis using the Pandas library and basic data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.</li></ul></div><br><div><strong>How to answer questions </strong></div><br><div><ul><li>Most of the tasks will involve writing Python code to answer the given questions. However, I may also ask you explain or interpret aspects such as your approach, code and results. In the questions I will make clear where and when a textual explanation or answer is expected.</li><li>The main focus is on the correctness and suitability of your Python code and explanations. In general, I do not judge the efficiency and conciseness of your code. However, I will deduct points if your code is chaotic and non-Pythonic</li><li>In certain situations, you may wish to add comments (Markdown or code comments). This can be useful to explain your thought process or assumptions. Sometimes, this helps to demonstrate your skills even if the code is not working as expected.</li></ul></div></div><br><p></p>
